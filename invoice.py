"""
Create a Python program that generates a simple invoice for a customer. The program
 should allow the user to input the name, price, and quantity of items purchased. It should
 then calculate the total cost for each item (price Ã— quantity), display the itemized list, and
 include a final total for the invoice. If applicable, it should apply the discount from the
 previous section to the total cost and display the final amount.
 Here's a possible structure for the invoice:
 Item name 1.
 Item price 2.
 Item quantity 3.
 Total for that item 4.
 Subtotal of all items 5.
 Discount applied (if any) 6.
 Final amount to be paid
